# Build Guide

Im lazy heres a bunch of pics.
Read the whole build guide before you start.
Your cheap keyboard is no longer cheap if you mess upo the controller.
If your diodes are backwards you may fry your controller.

![everything you need](https://i.imgur.com/iPbKYFo.jpeg)

you only need:

- 1 controller
- 36 choc switches & caps
- 41 diodes
- 2 pcbs
- 2 cases

![back support](https://i.imgur.com/Qn5C2rj.jpeg)

So the 2 sides of the keyboard are held together with the controller.
this makes the keyboard very week the back support is there to offer well support to the keyboard this makes it just as strong as any other keyboard.

snap off the back support included with the pcb

jlc leaves it very messy just clean it up or not up to you.

This is the correct diode direction.
Black bar towards white bar on footprint.
If you dont know 30 second how to smd diode:

- solder one side
- hold diode with tweezers
- reflow pad
- push diode into liquid solder
- remove heat
- let go
- solder other side

All the diodes done for both sides.
Make sure of 3 things:

1. make sure you flip one pcb
2. you solder the extra diodes needed for square matrix
3. if you are using the 3d printed case from the repo, none of your diodes can be poking up they all need to be flat

## Controller

install the pins from your controller into the back support.
the pins are needed for alinement only, you can solder them but the castellated pads are doing the work.

install the black bar on the out side of the keyboard through the back support through the pcb and into the controller.

push the whole thing down until its square and tack in one corner of the controller.
Do this for all corners, the controller needs to be sitting flat to use the solder pads.

Once square solder all the bads making sure you flow down onto the pcb.

trim the pins or remove them and do the same thing for the back

## switches

install all your switches and solder them

# Case

you may need to clean up the mouse bites.
Then slide the case on from the out side in.
